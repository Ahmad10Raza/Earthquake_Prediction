# Earthquake_Prediction
## **Description**: 
**It is well known that if a disaster occurs in one region, it is likely to happen again. Some regions have frequent earthquakes, but this is only a comparative amount compared to other regions.
So, predicting the earthquake with date and time, latitude and longitude from previous data is not a trend that follows like other things, it happens naturally.**
